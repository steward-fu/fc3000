# FC3000
![Alt text](imgs/main.jpg)
  
## Introduction
Since there are many variants (with different screen panel), all of steps written in here may not work on your FC3000. It means your FC3000 may become bricked ! FC3000 specs are almost same as miyoo handheld. So, I spend some time on porting kernel, which obtained source from miyoo repo in my github. Most of resources that include toolchain and buildroot are same as miyoo ones. Therefore, some steps written in here may be same as miyoo. If it is not clear in here, you can refer to miyoo repo. Now, all of porting tasks are complete, which can boot into GMenu2X desktop and play some porting games and emulators from open source. It is time to share to all of you, enjoy !

## How to build Linux OS for FC3000
### Prepare environment
-  Install Debian 9 (x64)
  
### Prepare microsd (include prebuilt games and emulators)
```console
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/steward-fu/fc3000/releases/download/v1.0/fc3000_tft_od_jutleys_no_roms.img.7z
$ 7za x fc3000_tft_od_jutleys_no_roms.img.7z
$ sudo dd if=fc3000_tft_od_jutleys_no_roms.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```
  
### Configure toolchain
```console
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/steward-fu/miyoo/releases/download/v1.0/toolchain.7z
$ 7za x toolchain.7z
$ sudo mv miyoo /opt/
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/miyoo/bin
```
  
### Build kernel
```console
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/steward-fu/fc3000/releases/download/source/kernel.tar.gz
$ tar xvf kernel.tar.gz
$ cd kernel
$ ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- make suniv_defconfig
$ ./run.sh fc3000
```
### Build mininit (load rootfs in squashfs format)
```console
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/steward-fu/fc3000/releases/download/source/mininit.tar.gz
$ tar xvf mininit.tar.gz
$ cd mininit
$ make
```
### Build uboot
```console
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/steward-fu/fc3000/releases/download/source/uboot.tar.gz
$ tar xvf uboot.tar.gz
$ cd uboot
$ ./run.sh /dev/sdX fc3000
```
### Build rootfs (remember configure filesystem as squashfs)
-  download buildroot-2018.02.9 from https://buildroot.org
-  use config_buildroot-2018.02.9(in miyoo repo) and then make it
-  toolchain location: /opt/miyoo
-  rootfs location: output/images/rootfs.squashfs
